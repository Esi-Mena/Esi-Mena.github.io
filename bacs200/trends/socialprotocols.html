    <p> Social protocol is how the community interacts with one and another and how socializing is different between people. The reason I believe that this will affect the future is because it already has affected us for many years. In the past in order to socialize we would have to leave our houses and talk to people. It then switch to social media where people started socializing through text, dm's, or facetime. We still use social media now but the way we interact is different from before and it was because of the recent pandemic. Because of this pandemic we were behind doors and basically forgot how to socialize when quarantine was over. For some many were able to socialize and interact how they use too but for others they ended up building up anxiety and don't want to interact with anyone. Social protocol hasn't just changed for a community but for family too. Many don't really interact, they all go there separate ways and do there own thing on there phones or technology. Social protocol will keep changing because of technology. Technology keeps involving and might introduce to a new way for interactions. Technology might not be the only thing that affecting social protocol but its what's affecting it more quickly. Since social protocol is changing it could affect us in a good way or in a bad way. Humans were built for human interaction and we need it to survive but because were interacting in a way that is not so social it could start affecting us physically and mentally. The way the social protocol changes could destroy our future or build it.</p>
