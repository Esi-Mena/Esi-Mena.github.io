    <p> Technology has been affecting the future for many years that it has built out passed. It has changed many everyday things from the past from talking to someone in person to cellphones. From news letters on the street to the radio and television. From carriages to cars that drive themselves. Technology has helped us in many ways to make things convenient for us and because it helped us so much, people are trying to make technology to run and do everything for us. This can be good but this can be really bad. It already affecting many teens today. Its causing us to be antisocial and affecting our mental health. It can cause anxiety, depression, and stress. Its also affecting our physical health because technology is keeping us inside the house instead of getting us to exercise and go outside. In addition if technology starts taking over the next generations will start thinking less. They wont be as creative or intelligent and if technology fails then the world is going to end up in trouble. This could cause privacy to be released because if technology progress the security has to as well. Personal information can be stolen. There would be less employment because machinery will be taken over . People need jobs in order to pay for there food, home and bills. Technology can also help us in the future. Although  it might decrease some's people intelligence for those who do seek education it will be an easier way to get more knowledge an learn more things affectively.</p>
