    <p>Politics can have a big impact for our future. Our government is made up of politics and it basically controls how we live. Politics affect our future because it changes as time go on because events and situations happen where laws and rules have to change for things to run more slowly. Politics affect our rights. If our rights change slightly that can have a big impact because it could cause people to be happy about what they received or it could cause protest and riots affecting the peace. It can make decisions that can affect our daily life. Such as for our safety. They can decide how many policeman to protect a certain area. Rules for that certain are that people have to follow. They can also decide how much housing is available in that are for  people to move in to increase or decrease the population in the area. They can decide what sources are available such as clinics, colleges , and community centers. They can also influence many other factors that affect our life such as the economy, social change, the justice system. Social change is one of the reason why there is riots and protest such as the black lives movement. One of the big problems that actually causing tension on social media and between people is the justice system not being really fair to everybody which is discrimination and if there's discrimination that means not everybody has there rights. Politics can cause peace among people or hatred. </p>
