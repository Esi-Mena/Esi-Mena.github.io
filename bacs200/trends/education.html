    <p> Education can have a great impact for our future as a whole community and ourselves. With an education it can help someone build connections. With these connections it can help build a community and increase social interaction. With education it can help build new ideas and creativity for the future. It could build new technology that can do more work for us. Create better laws so there can be peace with the United States and the world. Someone can find cures for sicknesses that affect people deeply. Education can help the future solve problems that we have now. Going to school  and learning new skills and ideas can help  boost confidence which then can help with social interaction that builds communities that can create new ideas together for the future. People have a better  chance at getting job and showing that the degree in that market is valuable but also because of the increase of jobs being taken it can be a bad thing. It increases competition which could make it harder for those who don't have a job to get one. Education can introduce those to a field that we need more workers for. The more people who go and receive an education can influence other to go get one which could help increase creativity and ideas throughout the world. The more people go to get an education, education would most likely increase and progress which can help us think of things we never have thought before. Education is a great way for our future to expand and thrive.</p>
