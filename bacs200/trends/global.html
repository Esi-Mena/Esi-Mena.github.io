    <p> Global interactions is not people just interacting within the state but all around the world. This can affect our future with culture, the government, society. Interacting with others around can educate us about the culture and what other places live such as holidays, traditions, and foods. This can help bring more diversity within the community. It can also help us learn from one and another, seeing what works or not. For an example in the Netherlands there education system is different from the ones in the United States, China, India, etc.  If we see one system succeeding more then the one we are currently in we can adopt that system to help us improve our future and grow together as a community. Not just education but technology, the justice system, and social problems. It can also introduce us to the problems around the world and what we need to prepare for or see how we can help out one another to gain peace. It builds connections among the world. Since there is diversity between country's it could also cause problems. Trying to learn about the justice system or technology from other countries , they might take it as a threat. Also not alot of the other countries know about technology that others have so if they discover that technology they might study it and use it or enhance it to use against other countries. Global interactions can have a really big impact on our future we just how to be careful.</p>
