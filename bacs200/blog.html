            <p class="lead"><mark>Social media</mark> is great way to stay connected to friends, family or even meet strangers. Its a way for someone to express themselves. Throughout the years as social media became popular such as facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and many more, alot more people started to join and make accounts. Theres celebrities who anounce there new projects or comapanies that try to sell a new product. Social media now is used more as a tool than for entertainment. Most of the time people find out whats going on with the world through social media than the news. Part of the reason for this is because of extremism. <mark>Extremism </mark>is when there is political or religouse views. For an example when theres a presendential election going on many will post about their opinions on who should be the next president and there reasoning. Because of extremism being a big a part of social media it has its ups and it has it downs. It sometimes brings people togethor because of there views but sometimes it causes some debates becuase information that is shared on social media spreads everywhere to anyone at anytime. Like they say if you share it on the internet it will stay on the internet forever.    </p>

            <h1 class="text-center">My Point of View</h1>
        <p class="lead border border-primary">I believe when it comes to social media, information should not be spread out to the comminty in this way. The reason for that is that Social media is too unreliable. Although it gets the information out there, its also getting in the hands of irresponsible and undectated people.Because of social media false information about politics, religion, and etc has been spreading rapidly and is more believed by the people than the factual information. Social Media is mostly run by kids and teens and they are giving information about there political views wich is good because its there right to state there opinion but because of there age and immaturity it lead to cyber bullying or in other words being "cancled" for not agreeing with them. They think more emotionally than logically. This then teaches the younger kids to think this way wich might not be the best choice. They need to be properly educated by a teacher, proffesor, or the school system but not some random perosn on social media.Extremist should spread there information through other sources either by interviews, blogs or anything as long the source is more reliable and the information can not be altered.Social Media is not the place for extrmist to spread information about politics or religion.</p>
